Policy: The policy considered in Ganong (2012): In 1979, the Georgia State Board of Paroles and Pardons instituted guidelines for how long an offender should serve in prison. The mean guidelines time is highly correlated with mean time served. In April 1993 (when the treatment took place), Georgia instituted new parole guidelines that led to longer prison terms for parole-eligible offenders. Although there was a general movement to get tougher on crime in the 1990s in Georgia, the guidelines change itself occurred without substantial notice in the world of Georgia corrections, and did not coincide closely with other major policy changes.
